  ## C# Concepts:
    Demonstrated in the InventorySystemProject and the Appointment Scheduler files:
    
    - Classes and Interfaces
      The graduate designs software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces
      to achieve specific goals.

    - User Interface Development
      The graduate develops user interfaces to meet project requirements.

    - Exception Handling
      The graduate incorporates simple exception handling in application development for improving user 
      experience and application stability.

    - Application Development
      The graduate produces applications using high-level programming language constructs to meet business
      requirements.

    - Object-Oriented Principles
       The graduate implements object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and 
       abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the applicationâ€™s scalability.

    - Database and File Server Applications
      The graduate produces database and file server applications using advanced constructs in a high-level
      programming language to meet business requirements.

    - Lambda
      The graduate incorporates lambda expressions in application development to meet business requirements
      more efficiently.

    - Collections
      The graduate incorporates nongeneric collections and generic collections in application development 
      to manipulate data more efficiently.

    - Localization and Globalization
      The graduate applies application programming interfaces (APIs) in application development to support 
      end-users in various geographic regions.

    - Advanced Exception Control
      The graduate incorporates advanced exception control mechanisms in application development for 
      improving user experience and application stability.
